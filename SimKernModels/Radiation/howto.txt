Requires matlab (and ideally the python matlab process hook provided by MathWorks)
Note, python 3.5 for compatibility with the matlab python process hook.
Also note, files f4.m and variableDefinition4.m need to be in GenomeFiles (so they
exist in two places).




Data generation (sim 0) run:

python3.5 __main__.py 0 /path/to/Radiation/v4.m.t 1000 int /path/to/Radiation



Simulations to generate similarity kernel (sim 1) run:

python3.5 __main__.py 1 /path/to/Radiation/v4allVec.m.u 1000 20 list /path/to/Radiation

(for a sim 1 run that uses only 3 important compartments / differential equations to
compute similarity matrix, use v4plus.m.u instead; results in a better kernel)
