Requires matlab (and ideally the python matlab process hook provided by MathWorks)
Note, python 3.5 for compatibility with the matlab python process hook.
Also note, files ode_equations.m and ode_equation_FT_leaf.m need to be in GenomeFiles
(they exist in two places).

Finally, need to adjust the hard coded paths found near top of the .t and .u files.



Data generation (sim 0) run:

python3.5 __main__.py 0 /path/to/Flowering/floweringModel.m.t 500 float /path/to/Flowering



Simulations to generate similarity kernel (sim 1) run:

python3.5 __main__.py 1 /path/to/Flowering/floweringModel.m.u 500 10 list /path/to/Flowering

(for a sim 1 run that uses only 3 important compartments / differential equations to
compute similarity matrix, use v4plus.m.u instead; results in a better kernel)

Note a sim 1 model with larger standard deviations, thus farther from the sim 0 model, is provided
in floweringModelWorse.m.u.
