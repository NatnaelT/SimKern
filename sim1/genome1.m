%this is the genomics file for the first patient
%this would come from our SIM0 run, and we'd have one such file for
%each of our K patients. If you guys are storing all K patients
%genome data in one file, which i think you are, you'll have to
%either break it up/write it out again as separate files, or, maybe
%nicer, just read in the relevant genome for each specific person
%from that master genomes.txt file (in which case you'll have to
%indicate in the read statement which person you are reading for.
