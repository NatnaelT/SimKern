+Question - what are the features we vary? Does it make sense to vary initial conditions?
Rate Constants?

Goal: Have at least 80 20 --> 50 50 0's and 1's by next Wednesday
Sim0 -
How many features to vary? Probably 10-30
K = 4 * F, where F is number of features
-F = 10, K = 40
-Vary some more parameters
-Figure out what the most important features are
-We don't want a junk similarity matrix, but we don't want it to be 'too good' either, otherwise AUC is just 100%


Eventually - get a KxK similarity Matrix S --> as long as we get a good similarity matrix,
            we'll have good machine learning

Challenges
-Getting anything other than 100 and 0
-Slight preference to parameters to initial conditions, but inits can represent the environment
-Add in some more junk variables to "confuse" the machine learning algorithm
-Put dollar signs around some that don't vary the outcome very much

Todo:
-Look up Marc Birtwhistle - does thorough modeling of signaling pathways; student in 2017 put out a detailed model
of models
-Doug Lauffenberger -
-Add MATLAB functionality
