# SIM1

# INTRODUCTION

SIM1 is the simulation enviornment where a large number of simulations are run for each member of 
a given population in order to compute similarity scores for machine learning. Given a total number of K
genomes in a population, we will run a total number of R simulations for each of the K genomes.
